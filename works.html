Schedule your 1:1 session

Book your first 1:1 Software Development or Digital Strategy mentorship session for a date & time that works for you. Mentorship sessions are available Monday-Saturday.

STEP 2

Prepare for mentorship

After you've booked for your first session, you'll receive a confirmation email including next steps. Before your first session, you'll be asked to fill out a short form that will ask you about your goals and expectations. This form will help me prep for your session to ensure your mentoring is personalized just for you.

STEP 3

Join your personalized session

Next, you're ready to join your 1:1 mentorship session! During your one-hour session, we'll review your goals and develop a strategy that works for you to help you meet your goals.

STEP 4

Execute on your action plan

You'll leave your mentoring session with an action plan giving direction on your next steps to take that will position you to succeed. Executing on this allows you to achieve your goals!
